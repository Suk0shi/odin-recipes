        <li>1 pound ground beef (or ground pork, or a mix of both)</li>

        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong><p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure it's ready for baking your lasagne to golden perfection.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Lasagne Sheets</strong><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagne sheets according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set them aside.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce</strong><p>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Add the ground beef (or pork) and cook, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and cooked through. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Stir well to combine. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce</strong><p>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the all-purpose flour and whisk continuously for 2-3 minutes to create a roux, until it turns a pale golden color. Gradually pour in the whole milk while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Add a pinch of ground nutmeg and continue to whisk until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the béchamel sauce from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagne</strong><p>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagne sheets over the meat sauce. Add a layer of the béchamel sauce over the lasagne sheets. Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella and Pecorino Romano cheese over the béchamel sauce. Repeat the layering process until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese on top.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Lasagne</strong><p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for 25-30 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the lasagne is bubbling and golden brown on top.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy</strong><p>Let the lasagne rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Slice, serve, and savor the mouthwatering layers of flavor in this Classic Lasagne recipe.</p></li>
