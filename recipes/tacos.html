    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Ingredients</strong><p>Gather all the ingredients listed in the recipe, and arrange them neatly on your kitchen counter. This will make the cooking process smoother and more enjoyable.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Protein</strong><p>In a skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef or your chosen protein and cook until browned and cooked through. Break it apart with a spatula as it cooks. Sprinkle the taco seasoning mix (or your homemade spice blend) over the meat and stir well. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Toppings</strong><p>While the protein is cooking, prepare your toppings. Dice the fresh tomatoes, shred the lettuce, chop the red onions, slice the jalapeño peppers (if using), and chop the cilantro. Mash or slice the creamy avocado for guacamole. Set out the grated cheese, sour cream or Greek yogurt, and lime wedges.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Warm the Tortillas</strong><p>Heat the corn tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave until they are warm and pliable.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Assemble Your Tacos</strong><p>Lay out the warm tortillas on a clean surface. Start by adding a generous spoonful of the cooked protein mixture to each tortilla. Layer on your desired toppings: diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, chopped red onions, sliced jalapeños (for some heat), guacamole, a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt, grated cheese, and a sprinkle of freshly chopped cilantro.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Squeeze on Some Fresh Lime</strong><p>Squeeze a wedge of fresh lime juice over each taco for a burst of zesty flavor.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy</strong><p>Serve your "Savory Symphony of Tacos" immediately while they're still warm and all the ingredients are fresh. Encourage your guests to customize their tacos with their favorite toppings and salsas.</p></li>
