    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients</strong><p>Begin by finely chopping the onion, mincing the garlic, and grating the fresh ginger. Cut your choice of protein (chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp, etc.) into bite-sized pieces. If you're using fresh vegetables, wash and chop them into your desired shapes and sizes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Vegetable Oil</strong><p>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat until it shimmers.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics</strong><p>Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger to the hot oil. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onions turn translucent and aromatic.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Add the Curry Paste</strong><p>Stir in the curry paste of your choice, adjusting the amount based on your preferred level of spiciness.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Sear the Protein</strong><p>Now, introduce the bite-sized pieces of protein to the skillet and cook until they are lightly browned on all sides, which usually takes about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the Spices</strong><p>Sprinkle in the curry powder, ground turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, and paprika. Stir well to coat the protein and aromatics with these aromatic spices.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Introduce Tomatoes</strong><p>Pour in the can of diced tomatoes, including the liquid. Stir and allow the mixture to simmer for 5-7 minutes until it thickens slightly.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Pour in Coconut Milk and Broth</strong><p>Add the can of coconut milk and the cup of chicken or vegetable broth. Stir to combine all the ingredients and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Simmer and Add Vegetables</strong><p>Let the curry simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the protein is cooked through and the flavors meld together. During the last 5-7 minutes of cooking, add the assorted vegetables, cooking until they are tender yet still vibrant.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Season and Serve</strong><p>Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Remove the curry from heat and serve it hot, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves if desired.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Accompaniments</strong><p>To complete your meal, serve your delicious curry with cooked rice or warm naan bread. Enjoy your homemade curry, a flavorful fusion of spices and ingredients that will delight your taste buds and transport you to a world of culinary delight!</p></li>
